To run the frontend :
### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a .env file in the root of the project and define the following variables:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3333/
```
### Step 2

### Step 3

## WHY :

## using react query 
I utilized TanStack Query (https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for handling API requests. It's remarkably powerful for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating state.

## using Shadcn
(https://ui.shadcn.com/docs). What's impressive about Shadcn is that it's  a collection of reusable components that seamlessly integrate into your applications. It is very helpful, especially for adding a dark mode feature.

## using zustand 
I utilized Zustand to establish a centralized source for managing authentication.
